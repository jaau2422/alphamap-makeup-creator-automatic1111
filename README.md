This is an app that automatically creates an alpha map for image to image upload in Stablediffusion
The map that is created is used to apply creative makeup looks to your face since it only generates on the area around your eyes and your mouth

The alpha mask creation uses open cv so you need to download the 68 facelandmarks model here
